    "text": "What is IOC?\nThe InforBio platform has developed an “Interactive Online Companionship” (IOC) specifically tailored to initiate researchers into bioinformatics. The IOC involved one-to-many virtual work sessions where companions are trained to analyze their own data.\nAll IOC programs are structured into a series of modules, with each module building upon the knowledge and skills acquired in the previous one. One module lasts one week, during which companions dive into online materials to ensure they understand and internalize the content. Companions then complete quizzes and exercises using both public and their own data to gauge their understanding, receiving personalized feedback on their work. To facilitate their learning, we provide access to computational resources such as Rstudio and Galaxy servers. The module wraps up with a 2.5 hours’ videoconference to recap the week’s material and address any questions. These videoconferences are recorded and made available for later viewing, ensuring continuous access to the learning resources.\nBy the end of an IOC, companions will be equipped with expertise and confidence to run their own analyses independently."

Do not distribute them without permission.\n\n\n\nSlack\nSlack is a dedicated workspace for communication and staying connected between sessions.\nIf you haven’t already use it, you need to create a Slack account.\nIf you have a Slack account, you can either connect to the account using this webpage, or use a desktop version on your computer. (Slack Windows desktop, Slack Mac desktop)\nAnd you will receive an invitation link to join the IOC Slack of your group.\n\nPost messages in the correct channel, e.g., “questions” for asking about course content.\nWhen asking questions, please be specific and clear with a minimal context, include screenshots or error message to help others understand the issue.\nWhen discussing a question, please reply in the thread to avoid flooding the channel.\n\n\n\nTrello\nTrello is a tool to help you stay organized and track your learning progress.\nYou will be invited to join a Trello board for this IOC. We will create one list per student, please add one card for each session to add your notes, summary, etc."
