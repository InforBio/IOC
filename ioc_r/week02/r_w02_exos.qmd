## Goals

- Get familiar with data types
- Get familiar with vectors and matrices manipulations
- Simulate your own biological data and test the normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test

## Data Types in R

Create variables to store the following types of biological data and check their class in R:

- The name of a gene (e.g., *BRCA1*).
- The number of samples in an experiment (e.g., 50).
- Whether a sample is treated or not (TRUE/FALSE).
- The four bases in DNA sequence: A, T, G, C.

```{r}
gene_name <- "BRCA1" 
class(gene_name)

num_samples <- 50    
class(num_samples)

is_treated <- TRUE  
class(is_treated)

dna_bases <- c("A", "T", "G", "C") 
class(dna_bases)
```

## Vectors

You have the following concentrations of a drug measured in five samples (in ¬µM): `2.3, 5.1, 3.8, 6.4, 4.9.` Perform the following tasks:

- Create a numeric vector to store the concentrations.

```{r}
drug_concentration <- c(2.3, 5.1, 3.8, 6.4, 4.9)
```

- Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the concentrations.

```{r}
mean_concentration <- mean(drug_concentration)
mean_concentration
sd_concentration <- sd(drug_concentration)
sd_concentration
```

- Subset the concentrations greater than 4 ¬µM

```{r}
high_concentration <- drug_concentration[drug_concentration > 4]
high_concentration
```

## Matrices

You‚Äôre working with expression levels of three genes (*geneA*, *geneB*, *geneC*) across five samples. The expression levels are as follows:

```
sample1: 10, 12, 15  
sample2: 20, 18, 22  
sample3: 14, 16, 19  
sample4: 8, 9, 7  
sample5: 25, 30, 28  
```

- Create a matrix to represent this data, with genes in rows and samples in columns.

```{r}
# Create the matrix
expression_levels <- matrix(
  c(10, 12, 15,
    20, 18, 22,
    14, 16, 19,
    8, 9, 7,
    25, 30, 28), 
  nrow = 3
)
expression_levels

## or create first samples' vector then combine them
sample1 <- c(10, 12, 15)
sample2 <- c(20, 18, 22)
sample3 <- c(14, 16, 19)
sample4 <- c(8, 9, 7)
sample5 <- c(25, 30, 28)
expression_levels2 <- cbind(sample1, sample2, sample3, sample4, sample5)
expression_levels2
```


- Add row and column names to the matrix.  

```{r}
# Add row and column names
rownames(expression_levels) <- c("geneA", "geneB", "geneC")
colnames(expression_levels) <- c("sample1", "sample2", "sample3", "sample4", "sample5")

## or
rownames(expression_levels) <- paste0("gene", LETTERS[1:3])
colnames(expression_levels) <- paste0("sample", 1:5)

expression_levels
```

- Calculate the mean expression for each gene (row-wise).  

```{r}
gene_means <- rowMeans(expression_levels)
gene_means
```

- Subset the data to show only samples where `geneC` expression is greater than 20.  

```{r}
# Extract geneC
geneC_expression <- expression_levels["geneC", ]

# Subset samples with geneC > 20
high_geneC_samples <- geneC_expression[geneC_expression > 20]
high_geneC_samples
```


## Test the Normality on Simulated Data

### Height

Use following code to generate the height (in cm) of 100 students:

```{r}
set.seed(1)
heights <- round(rnorm(n = 100, mean = 170, sd = 10), 1)
heights
```

**Normal Distribution**

A normal distribution (or Gaussian distribution), also called a "bell curve,"
is a way that data often naturally organizes itself when we measure something repeatedly in a population.

(figure obtained from this [source](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcommons.wikimedia.org%2Fwiki%2FFile%3AEmpirical_Rule_Normal_Distribution.png&psig=AOvVaw3im9_Hwoy2pWzBaORhnaym&ust=1734727389053000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBQQjRxqFwoTCIDm9aPZtIoDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAI))

It‚Äôs symmetric, with most values clustering around the average (mean, $\mu$),
and fewer values as you move farther away from it.

Many statistical tests (like t-tests or ANOVAs) assume that the data is normally distributed because this allows us to calculate probabilities and make inferences.
If the data isn't normal, these tests might give misleading results.

**Shapiro-Wilk Test**

The Shapiro-Wilk test is designed to check for deviations from normality,
*i.e.*, to check whether your data follows a normal distribution.
:::

The function `shapiro.test()` in R allows to perform the test of normality.

```{r}
shapiro.test(heights) 
```

**Test Hypotheses: H0, H1**

When performing a statistical test, you start with two opposing ideas, called hypotheses, that you want to evaluate:

- Null Hypothesis (H0):
This is the default assumption, often stating that there is no effect, no difference, or no relationship in your data.
- Alternative Hypothesis (H1):
This is the claim you are testing for something different from the null hypothesis.

When you perform a statistical test, the goal is to decide whether you have **enough evidence** to reject the null hypothesis (H0) in favor of the alternative hypothesis (H1).

**Type I error ($\alpha$)**

A type I error occurs when we reject the null hypothesis whereas it is actually true (false positive).

The probability (risk) of making a type I error is denoted as $\alpha$, which also called the significance level.
By choosing $\alpha = 0.05$, you‚Äôre saying:
"I‚Äôm willing to accept a 5% chance of incorrectly rejecting H0."

**P-value** 

The p-value is the probability of observing your data (or something more extreme) if the null hypothesis (H0) is true.

- If the p-value is small (e.g., ‚â§ 0.05):
  - There‚Äôs strong evidence against H0, so you reject it.
  - This suggests that the alternative hypothesis (H1) might be true.
- If the p-value is large (e.g., > 0.05):
  - There‚Äôs not enough evidence to reject H0.
  - This doesn‚Äôt mean H0 is true, it just means the data doesn‚Äôt strongly contradict it.
:::

Here, the H0 is the heights are normally distributed,
and H1 is the heights are not normally distributed.

If we take $\alpha=0.05$:
since the p-value (0.9876) is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject H0.
This means there‚Äôs no strong evidence to suggest the heights are not normally distributed.

Let's check the heights' distribution with a histgram!

```{r}
# Histogram
hist(
  heights, probability = TRUE, col = "lightblue",
  main = "Histogram with Bell Curve", xlab = "Heights (cm)", ylab = "Density"
)
# Add bell curve
curve(dnorm(x, mean = mean(heights), sd = sd(heights)), col = "red", lwd = 2, add = TRUE)

```
