Goals:

- Get familiar with data types
- Get familiar with vectors and matrices manipulations
- Create your own gene expression matrix and perform a Shapiro test on your data


## Create a Vector

```{r}
1:10 # numbers from 1 to 10
seq(10)
rep("A", 10)
```



```{r}
rnorm()
```

```{r}
colnames(named_mat) <- paste0("c", seq(ncol(named_mat))) # same as above line

ncol(named_mat)
seq(ncol(named_mat))

rownames(named_mat) <- paste0("r", seq(nrow(named_mat)))
```
