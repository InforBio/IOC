# Use `#` to write a comment (line) in your script
# Math with R:
2 + 2    # Yes, R can do math!
sqrt(16) # Square root.

# Create a variable:
x <- 5 # Now x is 5. You can reuse it!

# Inspect your environment:
## Look at the "Environment" pane, do you see your x?
ls()

# Load a package:
library(stats)

# Get help of a function (documentation):
?mean

# Quit RStudio properly
q()

# Setting Up an R Project

## Create an R Project {.smaller}

An R project keeps everything for your project in **one working directory**
and helps R to know where to look for your files.

. . .

1. In RStudio, go to *File* -> *New Project*
2. Choose *New Directory* and click *New Project*
3. Set a folder name (e.g., `my_project`) and select where to save it.
4. Click *Create Project*

. . .

You'll notice RStudio restarts, and now your project is set up!

![](images/in_rproj.png){width=50%}

::: {.notes}
An R Project is a way to keep everything for your work (scripts, data, outputs) in one place.
Think of it like a special folder where RStudio automatically knows where to look for your files.
It helps avoid problems with messy file paths.
:::

## Understanding File Paths {.smaller}

A **path** tells your computer where to find files.

. . .

- **Absolute path**, starts from the very top of your computer's folder
  - E.g.: 
    - In real-life: France, Paris, 9 Quai St Bernard, Building B, office 725 
    - On Linux/Mac: `/home/test_user/my_project/data/myfile.csv`
    - On Windows: `C:\Users\test_user\my_project\data\myfile.csv`

. . .

- **Relative path**, starts from your working directory (folder)
  - E.g.:
    - Building B, office 725
    - `data/myfile.csv` or `data\myfile.csv` (Windows)

## A Well Organized Folder

Tree structure:

```sh
my_project              # Your working directory    
â”œâ”€â”€ my_project.Rproj    # The R project configuration file
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md           # A short introduction of the project
â”œâ”€â”€ data                # Raw data files
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ raw_count.tsv
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts             # Your R code files
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ 01-analysis.R
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ 02-figures.R
â””â”€â”€ outputs             # Results, e.g., graphs, reports
```


:::{.notes}
example of bad home organisation: pillow in kitchen and microoven in the bathroom
The trunk is the main folder (your R Project).
Branches are subfolders for scripts, data, and output, ect.
By building a clear structure, youâ€™ll:
Always know where to find things.
Save time when coding in R or sharing your project with others.
Avoid messy files scattered everywhere.
:::


## Where Are You? {.smaller}

```sh
my_project              # Your working directory
â”œâ”€â”€ my_project.Rproj    # The R project configuration file
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md           # A short introduction of the project
â”œâ”€â”€ data                # Raw data files
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ raw_count.tsv
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts             # Your R code files
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ 01-analysis.R
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ 02-figures.R
â””â”€â”€ outputs            # Results, e.g., graphs, reports
```
<br> 

```r
getwd() # Get working directory
[1] "/home/test_user/my_project"
```

. . .

What are the absolute and relative paths of the script "02-figures.R"?

. . .

::: {style="font-size:75%"}
absolute path: `/home/test_user/my_project/scripts/02-figures.R`

relative path: `scripts/02-figures.R`
:::

. . .

```r
file.exists("/home/test_user/my_project/scripts/02-figures.R")
[1] TRUE
file.exists("scripts/02-figures.R")
[1] TRUE
```

## Need Some Help? {.smaller}

- Google it!
- Ask/discuss your question via Slack.
- AI (like ChatGPT) is your friend ðŸ˜‰, but be careful of false answers! (More details in session 6)

**Key points**:

- Explain your question step-by-step.
- Share the context.
- Use keywords.
- Try to rephrase the question.
