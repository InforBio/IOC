## Welcome to R!

1. Script Panel: Write your code here—it’s your "notebook".
2. Console: This is where R "talks back" to you (shows results).
3. Environment/History: Tracks your variables and past commands.
4. Files/Plots/Packages: For managing your files, viewing graphs, or installing tools.

Quick Tips:

- Run code: Highlight it and press Ctrl + Enter (Windows) or Cmd + Enter (Mac).
- Comment/ Uncomment code: Ctrl + Shift + C (Windows) or Cmd + Shift + C (Mac)
- Help is your friend: Type `function_name` in the search box or `?function_name` in the console for the documentation.
- Check all possible shortcuts: Tools -> Keyboard Shortcuts Help


## Setting Up Your Project {.smaller}

```r
getwd() # Get working directory
setwd() # Set working directory
```

Create an R project:

![]()

HERE: need a screen shot of creating project on the server,
then create the sub folders (scripts, outputs, etc)
then show the tree structure


Tree structure:

```sh
project_IOC/
├── README.md           # A short introduction of the project. 
├── data                # Raw data files (e.g., experiment.csv)
│   └── raw_count.tsv
├── scripts             # Your R code files
│   └── 01-analysis.R
│   └── 02-figures.R
└── outputs             # Results, graphs, or reports 
    ├── 01-analysis.xlsx
    └── 02-figures/
```

Separator: "/" (Linux/Mac) or "\\" (Windows)

Example: `project_IOC/data/raw_count.tsv`

```r
file.exists("project_IOC/data/raw_count.tsv")
basename("project_IOC/data/raw_count.tsv") # return the file name
[1] "raw_count.tsv"
dirname("project_IOC/data/raw_count.tsv")  # return the path
[1] "project_IOC/data"
```

## Getting Started in R {auto-animate="true"}

Basic commands:

```r
# Math with R:
2 + 2    # Yes, R can do math!
sqrt(16) # Square root.

# Create a Variable:
x <- 5 # Now x is 5. You can reuse it!

# Inspect Your Environment:
## Look at the "Environment" panel (top-right), do you see your x?

# Quit RStudio Properly:
q()
```


## Need Some Help? {.smaller}

- Google it!
- Ask your question via Slack
- ChatGPT is your friend ;)

**Key points**:

- explain your question step-by-step
- share the context
- use keywords
- try to rephrase the question


::: {.notes}
- what are you trying to do / what did you try?
- the warning or error message / your code / your data structure
- language name / function or package name / a specific problem
- try and iterate

## Quarto

## Today's Goals

- Get familiar with the RStudio's interface
  - Copy a file via RStudio
  - Import a data file into RStudio
- Generate your first Quarto report
